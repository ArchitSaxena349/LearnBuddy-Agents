# LearnBuddy — Frontend

This folder contains the frontend for LearnBuddy, built with a Vite + React setup.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (or compatible LTS)
- npm (or yarn)

Quick start (PowerShell)

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Run the dev server:

   npm run dev

3. Open the app in the browser

   The dev server (Vite) will print a localhost URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

   npm run build

2. Preview the production build locally:

   npm run preview

Notes
- If you use PowerShell on Windows, the commands above work as-is. On Bash/macOS/Linux, run the same commands in a shell.
- Environment variables can be defined in `.env` files (see Vite documentation).

More
- See `package.json` for available scripts and dependencies.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Build a full-stack EdTech platform called "The Imperials" that redefines digital learning using AI personalization, gamification, and augmented reality (AR). The system should address key challenges in traditional education such as rigid learning paths, low engagement, lack of emotional support, and limited hands-on experiences.

Features must include:

AI-personalized learning paths.

Gamified quests with badges, leaderboards, and interactive challenges.

Emotionally aware chatbots for mental health support, leveraging Gemini APi.

AR expeditions (e.g., virtual labs, historical reenactments) webGL.

Technology stack:

Frontend: React.js (Web UI)

Backend: Node.js

AI/ML: Gemini API

Databases: MongoDB
